# 3DHumanoidProject
3D Humanoid Project Based on Kinematic Analysis


How to Install This System
1. Make Sure NPM installed in your OS
2. Download This Repo and Create a directory for example "3d_hmd" then extract the download file in the directory
3. open your CLI and type "npm init" then "npm start" to install all packages required
4. This System contains 3 parts such as Boolean Animation, Interactive Motion and Custom Motion
5. type "nodemon index.js" to run the server

7. Boolean animation can be accessed easily see the videos about the boolean animation
8. For the other menu, the robot need to be connected before controll itself, switch on the power of the robot, then create a wireless connection by hostpot with SSID name "ArduinoNode" and passwrod "12345678" the notification will appear when the robot connected successfully.
9. See The video folder for more detail.


IMPROVEMENT:
1. The 3D model can be loaded more than 1 model,
2. UX need to be improved
3. Robot Code need to be imporved for increasing the smootheness
